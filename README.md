**Math Symbols Input** is a macOS [input method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) for typing mathematical symbols with LaTeX-style commands.
It works seamlessly with any Mac app.

# Installation

The latest version is Version 1.3. To install or update Math Symbols Input:

1. Download the [installer for the latest version](https://github.com/knrafto/MathSymbolsInput/releases/latest/download/MathSymbolsInput.pkg).
2. Open the installer and continue through the installation steps.
3. Log out and log back in (or reboot).

The installer can enable the input method automatically. If you want to configure input sources, see the [macOS help page on input sources](
https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/type-language-mac-input-sources-mchlp1406/mac).

# Usage

Type a backslash `\` to start a command. The text should appear underlined while the command is being typed to show the input method is active. While the input method is active:

* Typing normally by pressing letters, symbols, or the backspace key will edit the command.
* **Enter** or **tab** will replace the command with its math symbol. If the command does not have an associated math symbol, the command text will be inserted verbatim instead.
* **Space** will replace the command and insert a space afterward.
* **Backslash** will replace the command and start a new command.
* **Escape** will insert the command text verbatim (e.g. if you need to type `\alpha` instead of `α`).

## Default commands

To view a searchable list of all default commands, click the Math Input Symbols `∀` icon in the menu bar and select `View Default Commands...`.
The default commands are also listed in [this text file](https://github.com/knrafto/MathSymbolsInput/blob/master/MathSymbolsInput/commands.txt).

If you think some command would be broadly usable and should be a default command, consider opening an issue or pull request.

## Custom commands

To add your own commands, click the Math Input Symbols `∀` icon in the menu bar and select `Edit Custom Commands...`.
New commands will take effect immediately.

# FAQ

## Are there Windows or Linux versions?

Not yet, but hopefully soon.

## Can I use a keyboard layout other than the US layout?

Yes, Math Symbols Input uses the last selected keyboard layout. [Dead keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key)
will continue to work, but the macOS's press-and-hold [accent menu](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/enter-characters-with-accent-marks-on-mac-mh27474/mac)
unfortunately will not.

# Inspirations

Many programming languages are capable of inputting mathematical symbols, but this is usually limited to a single app. These include:

* [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/emacs-mode.html#unicode-input)
* [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/)
* [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html#features)
